	"i_blackjack": "Blackjack",
	"i_blackjack_description": "A dull, hefty bludgeoning weapon, also known as a “sap,” these weapons are useful mostly for their silent and non-lethal nature. A favored tool of kidnappers and other rogues, they are highly concealable but illegal if discovered.",
	"i_a_blade_or_two": "A Blade or Two",
	"i_a_blade_or_two_description": "Small daggers, knives, and shortswords are the most common forms of personal defense in Cardenfell. Used more as tools than as weapons, these blades can nevertheless be deadly in the hands of a skilled wielder, but are mostly useful due to their ubiquity and ease of concealment.",
	"i_spear": "Spear",
	"i_spear_description": "Once the most common weapon to see on a battlefield, owing to it being cheap to produce and simple to wield. Now only desperately poor hunters and outlaws will risk being caught with these illegal weapons, and even they may choose to break and abandon them after a single use rather than keep such contraband on their person.",
	"i_longsword": "Longsword",
	"i_longsword_description": "A weapon hearkening back to the Old Kingdom, long blades such as foils, arming swords, and dueling blades have begun to fall out of fashion in favor of pistols and other more advanced weaponry. Nevertheless, they are often useful for fending off multiple foes in melee, especially when used in conjunction with a shield.",
	"i_pistol": "Flintlock Pistol",
	"i_pistol_description": "A very short ranged weapon capable of penetrating most types of armor. Most widely available types of shot are cheaply made and will quickly wear down the gun’s mechanisms, so the danger-prone would be wise to invest in a contact for high quality ammunition. They are often carried in pairs due to the difficulty in reloading a single pistol.",
	"i_second_pistol": "Second Pistol",
	"i_second_pistol_description": "Second pistol",
	"i_rifle": "Flintlock Rifle",
	"i_rifle_description": "Likely the most accurate and deadly weapon in the world, but also the slowest to reload. As is always the case, great power must always come with a cost.",
	"i_crossbow": "Crossbow",
	"i_crossbow_description": "One needs not to be strong, swift, patient, or even terribly precise to wield this deadly ranged weapon with reasonable efficacy; they need only have plenty of time to reload.",
	"i_short_bow": "Shortbow",
	"i_short_bow_description": "These ranged weapons are ideal for firing repeat shots at unarmored targets from a comfortable range. While often thought of as weapons meant for the dexterous, a good deal of strength is needed to use them effectively.",
	"i_hunting_bow": "Hunting Bow",
	"i_hunting_bow_description": "Best for shooting animals at under 30 paces, homemade bows aren’t ideal for combat, and despite their limited utility, they are just as illegal as more effective weapons. Some peasants in isolated rural areas will nonetheless risk a possession charge for the sake of making their hunting easier.",
	"i_longbow": "Longbow",
	"i_longbow_description": "While it has a greater effective range than other bows, it’s somewhat cumbersome and demanding to wield. Only carried by those intent on ambushing targets from a great distance, or who wish to chase some romantic ideal of traditional brigands.",
	"i_buckler": "Buckler",
	"i_buckler_description": "+1d resist. A small shield, easily carried on a belt, with a metal protrusion for deflecting attacks. In a skilled hand it can be effective at parrying blows, but it cannot meaningfully defend against the strikes of heavy weapons or ranged attacks.",
	"i_round_shield": "Heavy Round Shield",
	"i_round_shield_description": "+1d resist. While not optimally shaped or weighted, a great hunk of wood is the best choice for one who wants to ensure that a blocked attack will be completely absorbed regardless of the skill or positioning of the blocker.",
	"i_knightly_shield": "Knightly Shield",
	"i_knightly_shield_description": "+2d resist. These uniquely shaped wooden shields reinforced with leather are only produced for the upper echelons of the military, and bear the heraldic markings of their rightful owner.",
	"i_leather_armor": "Leather Armor",
	"i_leather_armor_description": "Soaks 1 harm. Treated leather can absorb impacts quite well, but can only defend against bladed attacks if it suffers a relatively glancing blow, and should only be worn as armor by the swift and brave.",
	"i_chainmail": "Chainmail",
	"i_chainmail_description": "Soaks 1 harm, +1d to resist. While a solid enough hit can pierce through or break apart the chain links, this lightweight metal armor will stand up at least once to a strike from nearly any weapon while still allowing its wearer plenty of maneuverability.",
	"i_plated_jacket": "Plated Jacket",
	"i_plated_jacket_description": "Soaks 2 harm. Decent armor that is simple to craft and repair; any scrap metal can be sewn into the interior of a quality coat. Unfortunately, any well aimed thrust or shot can land in between the arrangement of the plates, nullifying the armor’s effectiveness entirely.",
	"i_lantern": "Lantern",
	"i_lantern_description": "While most brigands prefer to let their eyes adjust to the darkness rather than risk the attention a light brings, a lantern remains an occasionally useful tool.",
	"i_censer": "Censer",
	"i_censer_description": "A vessel for burning wood, attached to a sturdy chain. Despite their weaponization by brigands, they have yet to be officially restricted, perhaps in anticipation of resentment from the churches that use them to officiate certain ceremonies, or perhaps for fear of making this utility more popularly known.",
	"i_manna_wood": "Manna Wood",
	"i_manna_wood_description": "Unknown to all except the fae, who keep track of such things, the foreign sweet flowering manna tree is actually a distant cousin of ashwood. In arrow form, its wood is no different from that of any other tree, and when burned, its smoke has only a fraction of its relative’s potency. It is only the tree’s legal status that makes it an alternative worthy of consideration.",
	"i_burglary_kit": "Burglary Kit",
	"i_burglary_kit_description": "A bird call instrument, a set of cleverly disguised lockpicks, a spare set of clothes, some cured meat, a bottle of inhalational anesthetic, and a shuttered lantern all have one or two obvious uses, but a clever thief can find many more than that.",
	"i_tinkering_tools": "Tinkering Tools",
	"i_tinkering_tools_description": "Metal instruments for both detail work and heavy maintenance, an essential chemistry apparatus, and all that is needed to collect and refine certain basic elements make up a tinkerer’s toolkit. The function of any one piece is unlikely to be guessed by the layman, but the intent behind the set as a whole is plainly obvious.",
	"i_demolition_tools": "Demolition Tools",
	"i_demolition_tools_description": "Packets of saltpeter, timing mechanisms, and vials of various alchemicals are all essential for making a proper explosion. Typically disguised as fireworks or in smoking pipes, these tools are capable of providing little more than a colorful distraction without an additional key component: black powder.",
	"i_subterfuge_supplies": "Subterfuge Supplies",
	"i_subterfuge_supplies_description": "Capes and cloaks are common guards against the cold in Cardenfell, and combined with a bit of coal paint or mud, one can make a reasonably stealthy disguise to guard against detection in the dead of night. Creating more sophisticated costumes able to pass muster at vampiric social events typically requires access either to more fanciful clothing or a talented tailor.",
	"i_climbing_gear": "Climbing Gear",
	"i_climbing_gear_description": "Rope, rigging, pitons, and a hammer are common enough in Cardenfell, as being able to climb over the jagged bluffs and hills of the countryside often requires their use. Still, when used in an urban environment, these tools are likely to raise a few eyebrows.",
	"i_ashwood": "Ashwood",
	"i_ashwood_description": "The wood of ash trees can cause grievous harm to vampires, and its smoke can hide one’s presence from their supernatural senses. Ashwood is highly controlled, and carrying arrows of it is a crime punishable by death.",
	"i_black_powder": "Black Powder",
	"i_black_powder_description": "The ideal substance for making bombs and ammunition for firearms, as the much more common saltpeter creates more smoke than it does explosive force, and tends to foul a firearm’s mechanisms quickly.",
